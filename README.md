# WalmartAvailabilityChecker
A friend was sick of going to the walmart.com page to see if the PS5 was in stock, so I made this to run instead.

# How to use
Very simple, just run the script and give it the URL to a walmart.com product page. The script will check the page and let you know the time it was checked and whether or not the product is in stock. I even added some fancy color codes to make it easier!

# Issues
Many.
Since this was just a quick project for a friend, I didn't do any error handling and barely did any input validation, so it'll pretty much crash if you input ANYTHING other than a walmart.com product URL... and it doesn't crash gracefully...
